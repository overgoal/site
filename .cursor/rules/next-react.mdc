## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. **Request Analysis**
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, animation, etc.)
   - Identify languages, libraries, and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. **Solution Planning**
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing, performance, and accessibility

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify alignment with best practices

## Code Style and Structure

### Commenting Guidelines

- All code comments must be written in English
- Comments should be clear, descriptive, and explain the **why** behind complex logic or architectural decisions
- Avoid vague or generic comments like `// do something`
- Use comments to improve readability, not to repeat what the code already expresses

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Prefix event handlers with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/hero-section`)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use `const` maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use the `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSCs) where possible
- Minimize `'use client'` directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use `<Suspense>` for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of the deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (`data`, `method`, `action`)
- Implement URL state management with `nuqs`
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```ts
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const headersList = await headers();
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode();

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params;
const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
```

### Next.js 15 Advanced

1. **Server Actions**
   - Define where and when to move logic to the server
   - Patterns for designing reusable actions

2. **Streaming & Suspense**
   - Using `<Suspense>` in layouts and components to improve TTFB
   - Streaming patterns with `SuspenseList`

3. **Nested Layouts & Parallel Routes**
   - Organize UI into reusable modules
   - Share state between route segments

4. **Intercepting Routes**
   - Example of a modal over the main page
   - Optimized navigation flows

### Caching and Revalidation

- Conscious use of `export const revalidate = 60` vs `cache: 'force-cache'`
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) vs SSR vs SSG patterns
- Mini-guide for HTTP headers (`Cache-Control`) in API routes and middleware

### Edge Functions & Middleware

- When to use `export const runtime = 'edge'` vs `nodejs`
- Middleware patterns for authentication, A/B testing, and redirects
- Typed `middleware.ts` example with cookie validation

### Asset Optimization

- `<Image>` with `priority`, `placeholder="blur"`, and trusted domains
- Next/font: automatic subsetting and fallback fonts
- Preconnections (`<link rel="preconnect">`) and dynamic prefetching of critical routes

### Server-Side Validation & Typing

- Schemas with `zod` or `superstruct` in Server Actions and API endpoints
- Using `satisfies` to enforce interface compliance in props

### Monitoring & Metrics

- Integration of Web Vitals with `next/metrics` and `@vercel/analytics`
- Lightweight A/B testing using middleware and telemetry

### End-to-End & Component Testing

- Test structure with Playwright or Cypress in `tests/`
- React Testing Library integration

### SEO & i18n

- `generateMetadata` pattern in layouts
- Localized route configuration (`next.config.js` â†’ `i18n`) and typed `params`

### Security Checklist

- Header control with middleware (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`)
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS in Server Actions
