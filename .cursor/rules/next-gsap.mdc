## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. **Request Analysis**
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, animation, etc.)
   - Identify languages, libraries, and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. **Solution Planning**
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity, reusability, and animation flow
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing, performance, and accessibility

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Choose appropriate design and animation patterns
   - Consider performance implications (especially animation costs)
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify alignment with best practices

## Code Style and Structure

### Commenting Guidelines

- All code comments must be written in English
- Comments should be clear, descriptive, and explain the **why** behind complex logic or architectural decisions
- Avoid vague or generic comments like `// do something`
- Use comments to improve readability, not to repeat what the code already expresses

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Prefix event handlers with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/animated-hero`)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use `const` maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use the `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSCs) where possible
- Minimize `'use client'` directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use `<Suspense>` for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of the deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (`data`, `method`, `action`)
- Implement URL state management with `nuqs`
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```ts
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const headersList = await headers();
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode();

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params;
const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
```

### Next.js 15 Advanced

1. **Server Actions**
   - Define where and when to move logic to the server
   - Patterns for designing reusable actions

2. **Streaming & Suspense**
   - Using `<Suspense>` in layouts and components to improve TTFB
   - Streaming patterns with `SuspenseList`

3. **Nested Layouts & Parallel Routes**
   - Organize UI into reusable modules
   - Share state between route segments

4. **Intercepting Routes**
   - Example of a modal over the main page
   - Optimized navigation flows

### Caching and Revalidation

- Conscious use of `export const revalidate = 60` vs `cache: 'force-cache'`
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) vs SSR vs SSG patterns
- Mini-guide for HTTP headers (`Cache-Control`) in API routes and middleware

### Edge Functions & Middleware

- When to use `export const runtime = 'edge'` vs `nodejs`
- Middleware patterns for authentication, A/B testing, and redirects
- Typed `middleware.ts` example with cookie validation

### Asset Optimization

- `<Image>` with `priority`, `placeholder="blur"`, and trusted domains
- Next/font: automatic subsetting and fallback fonts
- Preconnections (`<link rel="preconnect">`) and dynamic prefetching of critical routes

### Server-Side Validation & Typing

- Schemas with `zod` or `superstruct` in Server Actions and API endpoints
- Using `satisfies` to enforce interface compliance in props

### Monitoring & Metrics

- Integration of Web Vitals with `next/metrics` and `@vercel/analytics`
- Lightweight A/B testing using middleware and telemetry

### End-to-End & Component Testing

- Test structure with Playwright or Cypress in `tests/`
- React Testing Library combined with your `useGSAP()` hook

### SEO & i18n

- `generateMetadata` pattern in layouts
- Localized route configuration (`next.config.js` → `i18n`) and typed `params`

### Security Checklist

- Header control with middleware (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`)
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS in Server Actions

## GSAP Animation Principles

### Using `startAt` for Precise Initial States

- Use `startAt` to define initial property states before tweening
- Helps avoid FOUC by setting pre-animation values

```ts
gsap.to(".box", {
  x: 300,
  opacity: 1,
  duration: 1,
  startAt: { x: -100, opacity: 0 },
});
```

### `useGSAP()` Hook & Scoped Animations

- Use `useGSAP()` from `@gsap/react` for automatic cleanup via `gsap.context()`
- Scope animations per breakpoint with `gsap.matchMedia()`

### Timelines & Performance

- Prefer `gsap.timeline()` with labels for controlled sequences
- Use `quickTo()` and `quickSetter()` for high-frequency animations
- Batch DOM reads/writes to prevent layout thrashing

### Preventing FOUC

```css
.hero {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

```ts
gsap.from(".hero", {
  autoAlpha: 0,
  y: 20,
  duration: 1,
  ease: "power2.out",
});
```

### Accessibility in Animations

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Avoid rapid motion or flicker that could cause discomfort
- Use Tailwind's `motion-safe:` variants

### Transform Management

- Always set transform properties with GSAP to avoid ambiguity
- Avoid mixing `%` in `x`/`y`; use `xPercent`/`yPercent`

### Using `xPercent` & `yPercent` Over Percentage Strings

- Avoid `x: "50%"`; prefer `xPercent: 50`
- Combine `x` and `xPercent` for fine control

```ts
gsap.to(".box", {
  xPercent: -50,
  yPercent: -50,
  x: 100,
  y: 300,
});
```

### Avoid Mixing CSS Transitions & GSAP

```css
/* ❌ */
.box {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

```ts
// ✅
gsap.to(".box", { width: 500, duration: 1 });
```

## GSAP Hooks Best Practices

### Viewport Detection

- Prefer `ScrollTrigger.isInViewport()` over `IntersectionObserver`
- Leverage GSAP utilities before adding external libraries

### Efficient Hook Design

- Create minimal, single-purpose hooks
- Provide customizable defaults (`amount`, `once`)
- Return useful values for conditional rendering (`isInView`)

### Optimal Implementation

- Use a single global `ScrollTrigger` monitor instead of per-element
- Use `onUpdate` callbacks with continuous state checks
- Always clean up with `kill()` in `useEffect` cleanup

### ScrollTrigger Patterns

```ts
const st = ScrollTrigger.create({
  start: 0,
  end: "max",
  onUpdate: () => {
    const inView = ScrollTrigger.isInViewport(element, amount);
    // Handle state changes
  },
});
```

### Animation Triggering

- Use `onEnter` to trigger animations on entering viewport
- Implement a `once` flag to prevent unnecessary repeats
- Memoize heavy animation setup

### Initial State Handling

- Perform an initial check on mount for elements already in viewport
- Handle SSR with `typeof window !== "undefined"`
- Define initial CSS states to prevent FOUC

### Dependency Optimization

- Include `isInView` in dependency arrays
- Prefer refs for values that shouldn't cause re-renders

## Example Usage

```tsx
// Component usage example
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useInViewGSAP } from "lib/gsap";

const AnimatedElement = () => {
  const elementRef = useRef(null);

  useInViewGSAP({
    target: elementRef,
    amount: 0.2,
    once: true,
    onEnter() {
      gsap.to(elementRef.current, {
        opacity: 1,
        y: 0,
        duration: 0.8,
        ease: "power2.out",
      });
    },
  });

  return (
    <div ref={elementRef} className="translate-y-4 opacity-0">
      Content to animate when in viewport
    </div>
  );
};
```
